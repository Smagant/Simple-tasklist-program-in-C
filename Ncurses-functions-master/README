                    Ncurses-functions

This folder contains functions created by me (Max Wällstedt) for use with
the Ncurses (or similar) library.

The license of the functions can be found in the root directory of each
function.

The current functions of this folder are:

    Ncurses-menu
        A menu in a curses-program where you easily enter some values
        and a menu according to those values will be printed.

    Ncurses-readstring
        Reads a string from the keyboard and prints it according to
        your specifications (like coordinates and maximum length).

If you find any bugs or come up with a more clever way to do something
in my functions, please tell me by email (max.wallstedt@gmail.com).
You can also contribute via git
(repo: https://github.com/MaxWallstedt/Ncurses-functions).
