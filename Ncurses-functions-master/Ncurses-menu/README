                    Ncurses-menu by Max Wällstedt

Ncurses-menu is a function for use with the Ncurses (or similar) library.
It will print a menu from the coordinates you entered with the contents
you specify (see below for details).

To use Ncurses-menu in your program, you just include "ncurses-menu.h" at
the top of your program and call the function "print_menu", as shown below.
It's important that you've already initialised the stdscr window before
calling print_menu. If you wish to use print_menu for a different window,
you'll have to edit Ncurses-menu's source code according to your needs.

The prototype looks like this:

    int print_menu (int sty,
                    int x,
                    int alts,
                    int width,
                    char title[],
                    char entries[][100],
                    int start);

"sty" is the y-coordinate and "x" is the x-coordinate where the menu's top
left corner will start printing from. (0, 0) is the terminals top left
corner.

"alts" is the number of entries your menu will be able to browse between.

"width" is the minimum width of your menu. If a word in your menu is longer
than the entered width, width will extend to the length of the longest
word.

"title[]" is the title of your menu. It will be printed centered in the top
cell of your menu.

"entries[][100]" is the 2-dimensional array containing the different
entries that your menu will browse between. It's important that each entry
is an array of 100 elements.

"start" is the first entry that will be highlighted when called.

The return value of print_menu is the final cells's number before you
pressed 'Enter'.

                    Compiling Ncurses-menu

I've only tried to compile Ncurses-menu with GNU's C-compiler (gcc).
On Windows, it compiles and runs fine with MinGW and PDCurses.
If you compile an exe-file on Windows, I would recommend using the -static
switch after -lpdcursed, as most Windows users don't want to install
libraries just to run your program.

On GNU/Linux, Ncurses-menu compiles with Ncurses (as one might suspect).
It's not necessary to compile with -static, and please don't.
I typically use -lncursesw, but you could probably use -lncurses just fine
if that's what you want.

I've included an example program ("ncurses-menu-example.c") to give you
a hint of how to use Ncurses-menu. The source code is probably more
interesting than running a compiled version. You can however compile it
with (assuming you currently stand in the src directory):

GNU/Linux:
    user@machine:/.../Ncurses-menu/src$ gcc -Wall *.c -o Menu -lncursesw

Windows:
    X:\...\Ncurses-menu\src> gcc -Wall *.c -o Menu.exe -lnpdcurses -static
